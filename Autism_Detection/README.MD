Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents a significant neurodevelopmental challenge, often accompanied by substantial healthcare expenses. 
Early diagnosis is pivotal in mitigating these costs; however, the current diagnostic process is protracted and cost-ineffective. 
The burgeoning prevalence of ASD worldwide underscores the urgency for accessible and efficient screening methods. 
Such screening tools can aid healthcare providers and individuals in deciding whether to pursue formal clinical diagnosis. 
The scarcity of datasets encompassing behavioral traits impedes comprehensive analyses aimed at enhancing the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of ASD screening. 
Existing autism datasets primarily focus on genetic aspects, leaving a gap in clinical or screening-related data. 
To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset tailored for screening toddlers for autism. 
This dataset comprises pivotal features conducive to in-depth analysis, particularly in identifying autistic traits and refining the classification of ASD cases.

This project would include 3 classification model to classify that following test case belongs to which category i.e the baby has traits of Autism or not.
Project would contain comparison of three model Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost.
The conclusion for early prediction/Detection of Autism.
