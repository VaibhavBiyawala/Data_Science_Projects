### Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net CNN Model

In today's world, the incidence of brain tumors is increasing at an alarming rate. However, accurately detecting these tumors in MRI scans poses a challenge due to the complex structure of the cerebral brain.

To address this issue, we have developed a U-Net based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for segmenting brain tumors and providing accurate results.

#### Key Achievements:
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.75%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 99.33%

Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both training and validation phases, offering a promising solution for accurately detecting and segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans.
